                <p>Tove Marika Jansson (9 August 1914 - 27 June 2001)
                was a Swedish-speaking Finnish author, novelist, painter, illustrator and
                comic strip author. Brought up by artistic parents, Jansson studied art from
                1930 to 1938 in Helsinki, Stockholm, and Paris. She held her first solo art
                exhibition in 1943. Over the same period, she penned short stories and
                articles for publication, and subsequently drew illustrations for book covers,
                advertisements, and postcards. She continued her work as an artist and
                writer for the rest of her life. <br> <br>
                Jansson wrote the Moomin novel series for children, starting with the
                1945 The Moomins and the Great Flood. The following two books, Comet
                in Moominland and Finn Family Moomintroll, published in 1946 and 1948
                respectively, were highly successful, and sales of the first book increased
                correspondingly. For her work as a children's author she received the Hans
                Christian Andersen Medal in 1966; among her many later awards was the
                Selma Lagerlöf Prize in 1992. Her Moomin stories have been adapted for
                the theatre, the cinema, and as an opera. <br> <br>
                She held a solo exhibition of paintings in 1955, and five more between
                1960 and 1970. She carried out several commissions for murals in public
                buildings around Finland between 1945 and 1984. She created the
                illustrations both for her own books and for classics including Alice's
                Adventures in Wonderland and The Hobbit.</p>

                simple as that.”</h2>

                <p>Although she became known first and foremost as an author, Tove Jansson
                    considered her careers as author and painter to be of equal importance. She
                    painted throughout her life. She exhibited during the 1930s and early 1940s,
                    holding her first solo exhibition in 1943. Despite generally positive reviews,
                    criticism induced Jansson to refine her style; her 1955 solo exhibition was simpler
                    in detail and content. Between 1960 and 1970 she held five more solo exhibitions.
                    The National Biography of Finland describes Jansson as going "against the
                    conventional image of an artist with her unusually even balance between visual
                    art and writing."</p>

                            <h1>Creating Moomin</h1>
                            <p>Jansson is principally known as the author of the Moomin books.
                                Jansson created the Moomintrolls, a family who are white, round and
                                smooth in appearance, with large snouts that make them vaguely
                                resemble hippopotamuses. She first drew a deliberately ugly creature
                                as a caricature of Immanuel Kant, the philosopher; a kinder version
                                became the Moomintroll. The first book, The Moomins and the Great
                                Flood, was published in 1945. Although the primary characters are
                                Moominmamma and Moomintroll, most of the principal characters of
                                later stories were only introduced in the next book, so The Moomins
                                and the Great Flood is frequently considered a forerunner to the
                                main series. The book was not a success, but the next two
                                installments in the Moomin series, Comet in Moominland (1946) and
                                Finn Family Moomintroll (1948), brought Jansson some fame.<br> <br>
                                Critics have interpreted various Moomin characters as being
                                inspired by real people, especially members of the author's family
                                and close friends, and Jansson spoke in interviews about the
                                backgrounds of, and possible models for, her characters. The
                                personality of Tuulikki Pietilä, Jansson's partner, inspired the
                                character Too-Ticky in Moominland Midwinter, while Moomintroll
                                and Little My have been seen as psychological self-portraits of the
                                artist. The Moomins relate strongly to Jansson's own family - they
                                were bohemian and lived close to nature. Jansson remained close to
                                her mother until her mother's death in 1970; even after Tove had
                                become an adult, the two often traveled together, and during her final
                                years Signe lived with Tove part-time. Moominpappa and
                                Moominmamma are often seen as portraits of Jansson's parents.</p>
