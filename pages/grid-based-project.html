                <h1>Grid Based Layout</h1>
                <p>Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas. <a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples" target="_blank">eleken.com</a></p>

                    <h2>The Cove</h2>
                    <p><i>Seth Rosenbloom</i></p>
                    <p>I’m resting on a tide-bleached tree, and you<br>
                    are looking for stones. Like we’ve always done,<br>
                    from back when our son was little. But now,<br>
                    it’s up to us to fill in the bucket. Stones lapped<br>
                    smooth by the force of the moon. Pigmented<br>
                    in colors of sibling planets. Mars-red. Jupiters<br>
                    with ghostly rings. You’re too far away to hear,<br>
                    and there is no pain, so I won’t make a fuss. It’s just<br>
                    thumps in my throat. My pulse runs up numbers<br>
                    on the screen of my watch, even as I sit here, still.<br>
                    My mind re-walks the trail through the forest<br>
                    to where the headlands open. Down the switchback.<br>
                    Past fallen old growths, their upended roots spider<br>
                    towards the sky. We’re the only ones who hiked here<br>
                    today. Even if there were cell coverage, how many hours<br>
                    before help arrives? So, breathe, bear down on the abdomen<br>
                    like the cardiologist said. Listen to the wind rush<br>
                    into this mouth of salinity. This cove, embraced by hills<br>
                    that shoulder hemlocks. Lava born from the mantel,<br>
                    cooled into outcrops, carved to pool star fish and purple<br>
                    anemones. Home of endless give and take.</p>

                    <h2>Observant</h2>
                    <p><i>Rocío Cerón | Translated by Dallin Law</i></p>
                    <p>The opus is present. In the shadowed drapes. The blushing, buttressing. The pouring. The loquat shadow epiphany. The ant fixedly holding its course, its plodding gait. The whispers amid forms. Time conversing among knots. The silence of clay, its all-encompassing reflection. The fallen branch. The ash tree presiding over a couple conversing. The water’s descent, in sing-song olive green. The old guest room privy to comings and goings. What’s left of a former shape. What’s present. <br>
                    Crossed metal threads ignite the dirt. Volcanic stone cuirass, a song disgorged into mud. Turbid. Meanwhile news filtered through, news of the bodies. The bodies. The gravity of a cement block as counterweight, a featherweight presence in the face of the crowd. Gravel. Dried footprints treading on thousands of memories. It turned out the numbers had names of their own. Nomenclature of skin and memory. Trunk. Pyramidal edifice housing a celestial vault. Tamped down and forged. Suspended beam. The structure’s stability. They said, then, that her name was rugged and fragile, like death’s.<br>
                    Shoulders. Stacked shapes. Teeth, hips, forehead. The reflection constitutes an infinite box. Matryoshka. Destruction or restitution. At an animalic trot, lend it your ears, eyes. Weeds. Garden in view, sunflower background where—exchanging glances—heliogenic green, birch green, felt green, verdigris green, linden green, frond green, mold green, chromium oxide green, reseda green, moss green, jungle green, bronze green, bile green, sap green, cadmium green, opal green, loden green, Umbrian green, victoria green, poison green endure.<br>
                    A private space. An illuminated space. The merest patch of refuge. Sunlight allays even rarefied thoughts. The rock engraved with the rushing breath of prehistoric gales. Aqueducts and fountainheads. Lime whitewashed walls shelter every word. Structures composed of wrought iron and windows, angles permitting an inward look, into the intimacy of stone. A volcanic hand cupping a bent thistle.<br>
                    Serenity and ceasefire. A brushed-against leaf puts anger to rest. Venation, pilosity, fury cast on the ground. Wind rushes across arms, barely a rumor, hinting at shapes. Earthworms and houseflies weave a millennial accord. The scars on your body could buttress caverns. Immaculate white, aspect of the true water—cadence—that turns the bite, the poison, into air.</p>

                    <h2>Migrant Life</h2>
                    <p><i>Paloma Chen | Translated by Julia Conner</i></p>
                    <p>The hyenas peer through the window. Their favorite<br>
                    pornography is misery. I hug myself and touch the<br>
                    veins on my belly. There where life has said<br>
                    here I will germinate, toward your mouth and I will kiss<br>
                    your entire face. I will massage your calves. I will<br>
                    help you, mamá, get your digital certificate<br>
                    and buy you a North Face jacket. I want<br>
                    to welcome you to the abundance of my<br>
                    belly. I need to convince myself you are not<br>
                    the fruit of my selfishness, that the world really<br>
                    misses you, even if it does not yet know you. I am on<br>
                    the other side of the ocean. I too once had<br>
                    a mother and father. I no longer remember where they are<br>
                    buried, but today I see them in your eyes. And<br>
                    from today on I am no longer alone. I have never been alone.<br>
                    I will sit you on my lap and sing you songs<br>
                    in the language spoken by the women who came<br>
                    before us and even if you do not speak it,<br>
                    my daughter, when you hear it you will remember<br>
                    there will always be a home. No matter how far it may be,<br>
                    because it is true that it is as far as the<br>
                    memories of father and mother. Even though I know<br>
                    you will study all the world’s languages because<br>
                    you’ll want to speak with the living and the dead<br>
                    to seek advice about the odor of sulfur and<br>
                    danger, about whether to improve our accent,<br>
                    about why strangers have no warmth<br>
                    in their gaze, about the material abundance of<br>
                    this proclaimed Global North, about if<br>
                    we are wasting our life in a land<br>
                    of filth, life, impure life, mixed life,<br>
                    hybrid life, polluted life, rich life,<br>
                    filtered life, aching life, extinguished life,<br>
                    life alight, life in ecstasy, motionless life,<br>
                    rooted down life, sacred life, migrant life,<br>
                    wounded life, migrant life, wounded life,<br>
                    open life, closed life<br>
                    migrant life</p>
